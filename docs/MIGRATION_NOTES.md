# Migration Notes - Old vs New Structure

## ✅ Completed Migration

The project has been successfully restructured from a monolithic to a fullstack architecture. Here's what changed:

## 📁 Directory Structure Changes

### Removed Directories

- ❌ `public/` → ✅ Moved to `client/`
- ❌ `src/` → ✅ Moved to `server/src/`
- ❌ `prisma/` → ✅ Moved to `server/prisma/`

### Removed Files

- ❌ `Dockerfile` (root) → ✅ Individual `client/Dockerfile` and `server/Dockerfile`
- ❌ `vercel.json` (old monolithic config) → ✅ Separate deployments

### Environment Files

- ❌ `.env` (root) → ✅ `server/.env` (for server configuration)
- ✅ Added `server/.env.example` for setup guidance

## 🚀 Script Changes

### ✅ New Scripts (Recommended)

- `setup-fullstack.ps1` - **Use this for initial setup**
- `npm run dev` - Starts both client and server concurrently
- `npm run dev:client` - Client only (port 3001)
- `npm run dev:server` - Server only (port 3000)
- `npm run install:all` - Installs all dependencies

### ⚠️ Legacy Scripts (Still work but may be confusing)

- `run.ps1` - Old menu-driven script (works but references old paths)
- `run-simple.ps1` - Old simple script (works but references old paths)
- `run-fixed.ps1` - Performance optimization script
- `start-optimized.ps1` - Performance optimization script

### 📝 Script Recommendations

**For new setups:**

```bash
# Use the new fullstack setup
.\setup-fullstack.ps1

# Then start development
npm run dev
```

**For existing setups:**

```bash
# Install dependencies for both client and server
npm run install:all

# Start development (both client and server)
npm run dev

# Or start individually
npm run dev:server  # Backend on port 3000
npm run dev:client  # Frontend on port 3001
```

## 🐳 Docker Changes

### Old Structure

```yaml
# Single service in docker-compose.yml
services:
  app: ...
```

### New Structure

```yaml
# Multi-service with Redis
services:
  redis: ...
  server: ...
  client: ...
```

## 🌐 Deployment Changes

### Old Structure

- Single deployment to Vercel or similar
- Everything served from one service

### New Structure

- **Client**: Deploy to Vercel (static files)
- **Server**: Deploy to Render (Node.js app)
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (unchanged)
- **Redis**: Render Redis or Upstash

## 📋 Configuration Changes

### Client Configuration

- New `client/js/config.js` for server URL configuration
- Dynamic Socket.IO loading from server
- Updated API endpoints to use server URL

### Server Configuration

- Environment variables moved to `server/.env`
- CORS configuration for client URL
- Socket.IO optimized for separate client

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Old Workflow

```bash
npm install
npm run dev  # Started single server on port 3000
```

### New Workflow

```bash
npm run install:all  # Install both client and server deps
npm run dev          # Start both client (3001) and server (3000)
```

## ⚡ Benefits of New Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear client/server boundaries
2. **Independent Scaling**: Scale client and server separately
3. **Redis Integration**: Real-time performance improvements
4. **Modern Deployment**: JAMstack-style deployment
5. **Development Efficiency**: Concurrent client/server development

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

1. **Environment Variables**: Must be in `server/.env` not root `.env`
2. **API URLs**: Client must configure server URL in `config.js`
3. **Socket.IO**: Loaded dynamically from server, not bundled
4. **Docker**: Use `docker-compose` instead of single container

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If old scripts don't work:

1. Use the new `setup-fullstack.ps1` script
2. Ensure `.env` is in `server/` directory
3. Update any custom scripts to use new paths

### If deployment fails:

1. Check `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
2. Verify environment variables in correct locations
3. Update any CI/CD pipelines for new structure
